Description: The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) provides public and restricted
    access to a growing compendium of single cell sequence
    data. BiocHCADataAccess demonstrates how single cell data is
    represented in R / Bioconductor. The demonstration then
    illustrates data can be accessed through the HCA web site, and
    more programmatically using Bioconductor packages such as
    HCAMatrixBrowser and HCAExplorer. Once represented in R /
    Bioconductor, HCA data can be analysed using the very rich single
    cell analysis tools outline in the online resource 'Orchestrating
    Single Cell Analysis' in R / Bioconductor.
