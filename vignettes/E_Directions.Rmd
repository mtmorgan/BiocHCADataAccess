# AnVIL and the Terra platform

[AnVIL][] and [Terra][]

- US NHGRI (Google) cloud-based computation and data access environment.
- Fast access to large public and protected consortium-scale data.
- Highly scalable computational workflows.
- RStudio and Jupyter notebook environments

HCA on Terra

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hca-export.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/hca-terra-export.png")
```

- Easily 'export' experiments to terra, including large files.
- Files are exported as links.
- Data does not leave the cloud.
- Fast movement from storage to compute nodes.
- Workflows available within AnVIL, e.g., the [HCA Optimus Pipeline][].
- No 'egress' charges.

[HCA Optimus Pipeline]: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/featured-workspaces-hca/HCA_Optimus_Pipeline


Bioconductor on Terra

- Growing suite of workspaces highlighting Bioconductor packages,
  workflows, and tutorials.
- HCA examples available.
- Early access? Contact [me][] with your Terra login email and ask to
  be added to the Bioconductor\_User group.
